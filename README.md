# ‚ù§Ô∏è K√¢zii's Indicators üõ†Ô∏è

## Quick Pre-Caution
This datapack is mostly automated by itself, but there is a pre-caution that needs to be taken:
Make sure coordinates from 0 255 0 to 1 256 0 are cleared with no obstructions.

## Performance Rating
Recommended for mid-range to high-range PCs,
strictly advising against low-end PCs.

It handles fairly well with a mid-range to high-range PC, lower-end ones would start form a slower gameplay.

## Quick Overview
- This datapack can hold up to 2034 name labels. (aka. Maximum Storage Array Limit)
- Has health indicators
- Has block data indicators
- Has damage & heal indicators
- Has short kill amount indicators for the players
- Variable name labels (Both by a name tag and when spawned in with a name.

## Intended-Use
This datapack is intended for mainly-survival, especially with new worlds.
Already existing worlds should not be affected by it as much with how it was built.

### **Strongly advise against installing this datapack into a minigame or map in any type.**
It can lead to many incompatibility issues:
especially loss of names, not intended name changes, overall can cause lag with many other systems in the minigame / map.

## Warnings
When installed and implemented, the game will slow down for rougly 5 to 10 seconds to store all currently existing name labels. (Cannot garantuee full name saves.)
For larger worlds, the game would maybe slow down for over 15 seconds, it all comes down to how many entities have a name assigned in your current world.

When you decide to remove the datapack, please run `/trigger uninstall_kz-indicators`,
give it a few seconds and it should be done uninstalling, you can afterwards remove it from the files if `/reload` hasn't been ran.

### **Do not spam `/reload` and `/trigger uninstall_kz-indicators`**
This datapack is very vulnerable during these times.

## Name Slots
If you decide to get rid of your name slots, then run `/trigger reset_names_kz-indicators`.
Again, do not spam it.

## Multiplayer
This datapack is multiplayer-friendly (At least I hope with the way I tested), you can have

## Side Note
I can not garantuee it is gonna be problem-free. However any damages caused by my datapack I will not be responsible for, unless I did not mention any warnings about that situation in this file. Otherwise, if you did something that was advised against, I will not be taking responsibility.

# Enjoy the datapack.
